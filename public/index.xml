      <description>Deterministic Querying for the Distributed Web  Brendan Oâ€™Brien
Michael Hucka November 2017 Abstract The current infrastructure that underlies the distribution and processing of data over the Internet has enabled dramatic advances in a wide variety of human activities. Recent trends promoting open data promise even greater benefits as the number and variety of networked datasets grow. However, while current technologies and architectures obviously do work, they also show signs of systemic inefficiencies that impede effective large-scale discovery, distribution, preservation and reuse of datasets.</description>

      <description>QRI Qri (pronounced &amp;ldquo;query&amp;rdquo;) is built around reducing the barriers to data. I believe the various approaches to working with data will benefit from an alternative view that aims to equally address all barriers to data access, instead of prioritizing one over the other.
Before starting, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that when I mention of &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m actually referring to structured data. Almost all digital information has at least some degree of structure.</description>
