  <p><strong>The world is generating data at a rate that will soon outpace our current means of storing and using it effectively. Without a dramatic shift, we will lose out on the incredible discoveries and insights that lie deep within the information we generate.  
  The world needs new tools for answering its questions.</strong></p>
  <p>Qri is building open source capabilities to allow indexing, searching (querying) and linking massive datasests on the distributed web.</p>
  <p>We work at the intersection of open source software development, data sharing via distributed networks, and environmental stewardship.</p>
