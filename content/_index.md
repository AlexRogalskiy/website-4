# a home for datasets
If you’ve ever “tracked changes” in a text editor, you’ve used a *version control system*. Programmers have been using version control systems for decades to coordinate and collaborate on software projects of all sizes. Go to github.com and you’ll see millions of people using version control to enhance & build upon each other’s work. Github’s underlying technology – git – popularized some magic sauce that has inspired an entire generation of programmers.

Even if you’re not a programmer, there’s a good chance you’ve used a spreadsheet, which can be a kind of dataset. Have you ever had trouble synchronizing a spreadsheet? How about getting two spreadsheets to talk to each other? Have you ever made a spreadsheet you’re actually kinda proud of, only to forget about it because, well, it’s a spreadsheet?

**qri is a version control system just for datasets.** Bringing the same coordination & collaboration tools programmers have enjoyed for decades. qri starts with strong technical foundations, but is aimed at providing understandable tools to allow people who do and don’t program to collaborate, bridging the gap between spreadsheets and databases.

​The world is producing more data every day. We believe this data deserves a proper home, a place where data is open, discoverable, vettable, and frictionless. We hope you’ll join us.
