Before we get started, let's make sure you're in the right place:

* So far, these tutorials are for the **command-line version of qri**. If the command line isn't your thing, you'll want to **check out our [desktop app](/download)**, no programming or command line experience required!
* qri CLI currently only works on unix systems (macs are a unix system)
* we haven't yet finished reference documentation, the [godocs for our dataset package](https://godoc.org/github.com/qri-io/dataset) serve as a stand in while we get those sorted
* if you're looking to file an issue or a bug, check our [github repo](https://github.com/qri-io/qri)
