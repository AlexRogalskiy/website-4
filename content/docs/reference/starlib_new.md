# Starlark Standard Library

All qri transforms have access to "starlib", a community-driven project to bring a standard library to the starlark programming dialect. We here at Qri need a standard library, and we thought it might benefit others to structure this library in a reusable way. We are a little biased towards our needs, and will be shaping the library primarily toward's Qri's use case.
