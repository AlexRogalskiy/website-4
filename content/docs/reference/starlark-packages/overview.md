metaDescription: "Learn how we've extended the core functionality of the Starlark language with these helpful packages"
---

Starlark Packages are like code libraries which can be imported into your Qri transform scripts to provide more functionality.  You can do things like parse and write CSVs, handle timestamps, use regular expressions, etc.

To that end, we've created a open source standard library of packages that extend Starlark, known collectively as "Starlib".  We're constantly improving Starlib to make Qri transforms more flexible and powerful.

## Starlib: Starlark's missing standard library

Starlib is a community-driven project to bring a standard library to the starlark programming dialect. We needed a standard library, and we thought it might benefit others to structure this library in a reusable way.

You can find [Starlib's source code](https://github.com/qri-io/starlib) and on Github.  Feel free to open an issue with a feature request or bug report.
