The section title says "libraries", but what we're really talking about are "packages" that can be imported into your Qri transform scripts to provide more functionality.  You can do things like parse and write CSVs, handle timestamps, regular expressions, etc.

To that end, we've created a standard library of packages that extend Starlak, and they are known collectively as "Starlib".  We're constantly improving Starlib to make Qri transforms more flexible and powerful.

## Starlib: Starlark's missing standard library

Starlib is a community-driven project to bring a standard library to the starlark programming dialect. We needed a standard library, and we thought it might benefit others to structure this library in a reusable way.

You can find [Starlib's source code](https://github.com/qri-io/starlib) and on Github.  Feel free to open an issue with a feature request or bug report.
