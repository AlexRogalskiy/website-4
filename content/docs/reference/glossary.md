Qri is filled with all sorts of weird words and terrible acronyms. This page is to make them less terrible.

#### the Distributed Web
Ugh, ok this is a biggie. 

#### Dataset

#### [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)
IPFS stands for the inteplanatary file system, which is a distributed web protocol. IPFS is the default network qri uses to store & publish datasets.

#### qri
I know, I'm so sorry for doing this to the world, but I'm hoping we can all learn to see "qri" and say "query". If you don't do that, no one should get upset. I named the project "query" because I believe the point of working on datasets together is to ask better questions. "Questions" in machine world are called queries.
