Data stored on qri has a few opinions about datasets:
* a dataset is a single file
* the root of a dataset is an array
* when possible, don't transform or alter data
* invalid data is fine, ill-formatted data is not

This restriction might seem silly at first if you're coming from a world of databases.

## The root of a Dataset is an Array

## When possible, don't transform or alter data

## Invalid data is fine, ill-formated data is not
