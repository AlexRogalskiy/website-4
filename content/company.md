Qri is a 5-person startup lucky enough to work with a _wonderful_ community of friends. We do work in Brooklyn, NY.

We are:

Brendan, the founder.
Kasey, the dev.
Dustin, the dev.
Tom, the data.
Rico, the ops.

One day we'll get around to writing a proper company description, but if you want to get a hold of us, feel free to email sparkle_pony_2000 at-cymbal qri.io
