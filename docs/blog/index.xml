      <description>I’m delighted to introduce a project a few others and I have been working on for the last few years. It&amp;rsquo;s called Qri (pronounced &amp;ldquo;query&amp;rdquo;. I know, I’m sorry). Qri is about data. Instead of telling you about a bunch of software, I’d like to tell you the story behind why Qri exists.
Two-ish years ago I came across an article in the Washington Post about a group of volunteers getting together for an event at the University of Toronto.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dustin, and I work on Qri, helping build our tool for reusable, reproducible, reliable datasets on IPFS. My focus since joining earlier this year has been improving the stability and especially the performance of our application backend. A few months into working on this task, I was especially pained at how slow our entire unit test suite was taking to run - up to nearly 5 minutes on my machine.</description>

      <description>The world of linked data is built on shaky foundations that prevent a true data commons from emerging. The problem isn’t with the data, but with the way data is linked. Specifically, the way links are addressed.
An address is a uniform, shorthand way of referring to things. Geographic addresses are an obvious example. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is the address of the White House. 268 Elizabeth St. is the address of my childhood home.</description>
